# Robovac Adventure â€” Mini-Game Project ðŸš€

## ðŸ“œ Project Description
**Robovac Adventure** is a mini-game developed in Unity where I practice and improve my game development skills. The story is simple: a robot vacuum cleaner embarks on an adventure across six different locations, overcoming various obstacles.

- ðŸ§© The **first part** of the game (Levels 1â€“3) consists of 3D puzzles and parkour challenges.
- ðŸŽ® The **second part** (Levels 4â€“6) is a 2D Sokoban-style game with logic-based gameplay.

The goal of this project is to strengthen my Unity skills and gain hands-on experience in game development. Itâ€™s not a groundbreaking game â€” just a personal learning project as I take my first steps into game creation. After completing it, Iâ€™ll move on to the next Unity course with a focus on programming.

## ðŸ¤– AI Usage
Since my current knowledge of C# and the Unity API is still limited, I actively use AI (including ChatGPT) to assist with writing and adapting code.  
**All the code** for this project is generated with the help of AI, while my main task is to integrate it into the project and test how it works.

At this stage, Iâ€™m not aiming to dive too deeply into programming. Instead, the focus is to become familiar with Unity and create basic game mechanics.

## âœ¨ Conclusion
This is an educational project designed to help me gradually master the basics of Unity.  
Itâ€™s not meant to be a big or complex game, but itâ€™s a valuable step toward becoming a better game developer.  
After completing this project, Iâ€™ll continue learning Unity and programming to progress even further.
